# cognitOS Event-Driven Architecture & State Machines

This document describes the event-driven simulation architecture introduced to replace
synchronous `Thread.Sleep`-based blocking in cognitOS, and the hardware state machines
that model a Minix 1.1-era PC.

---

## 1. Overview

The original sidecar used `_hw.BlockFor(latencyMs)` — a direct `Thread.Sleep` wrapper — to
simulate hardware latency. This blocked the entire sidecar thread, causing all output to
arrive at once (the engine side queued lines until the thread unblocked).

The new architecture has three layers:

```
IPC Protocol (EmitLine)
    └─ Engine delay queue  (engine/src/systems/engine_io.rs)
           └─ C# UnitOfWork.ScheduleOutput  (Kernel/UnitOfWork.cs)
                  └─ KernelEventQueue        (Kernel/Events/KernelEventQueue.cs)
                         └─ Hardware state machines (Kernel/Hardware/)
```

---

## 2. IPC Protocol Extension

### `EmitLine` event (`engine-io/src/lib.rs`)

```rust
EmitLine { text: String, delay_ms: Option<u64> }
```

The sidecar sends `emit-line:<delay_ms>:<text>` instead of plain `output:<text>`.  
The engine intercepts this **before** `apply_event` and stores it in a per-`EngineIoRuntime`
delay queue.

### Engine delay queue (`engine/src/systems/engine_io.rs`)

```
EngineIoRuntime.delayed_lines: Vec<(due_at_ms, String)>
EngineIoRuntime.accumulated_ms: u64
```

Each frame: `accumulated_ms += dt_ms`. Lines whose `due_at <= accumulated_ms` are flushed
to terminal output in order. On scene change or sidecar exit the queue is cleared.

This decouples simulation time from wall-clock time — if the engine runs at 60fps the
lines still arrive at the right *game* timestamps, not real-world ones.

---

## 3. C# Output API

### `IUnitOfWork.ScheduleOutput(string line, ulong delayMs)`

The primary way commands emit delayed lines:

```csharp
uow.ScheduleOutput("64 bytes from 198.145.20.140: icmp_seq=0 ttl=51 time=183ms", 200);
uow.ScheduleOutput("64 bytes from 198.145.20.140: icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=179ms", 200);
```

Delays are **cumulative** within a UoW session: the first line is at +200ms, the second
at +400ms, and so on. This mirrors how `ping` output looks on a real machine.

`UnitOfWork` resolves the output sink:
1. `GameTextWriter.Sink` — fast path (used by terminal shell)
2. Reflection fallback on `_sink` field — for any other `TextWriter` wrapping

`PipedUnitOfWork` (redirect/pipe decorator in `MinixExecutionPipeline`) delegates to
the inner UoW, preserving the cumulative counter.

### `DelayedOutputWriter` (`Framework/Transport/DelayedOutputWriter.cs`)

A `TextWriter` that wraps an `IOutputSink` and calls `SetNextLineDelay(ulong)` before
`WriteLine`. Used internally by `EasterEggOutput.Delayed(uow)`.

### `EasterEggOutput.SimulatePing(IUnitOfWork uow, params string[] lines)`

Helper used by all easter-egg ping hosts. Applies delays based on line content:

| Line prefix / content       | Delay       |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `PING ...` header           | immediate   |
| `64 bytes from ...`         | 200ms       |
| `Request timeout`           | 1200ms      |
| First stats line (`---`)    | 150ms gap   |
| Remaining stats / `net:`    | immediate   |

All ~50 easter-egg hosts use this helper — no `uow.Out.WriteLine` remains.

---

## 4. KernelEventQueue (`Kernel/Events/KernelEventQueue.cs`)

A priority-queue based scheduler keyed on `dueAtMs` (uptime milliseconds):

```csharp
public enum KernelEventKind { Timer, Output, Completion, Disk, Network, Modem }

public record ScheduledKernelEvent(
    ulong DueAtMs, ulong Sequence,
    KernelEventKind Kind,
    Action Action,
    string? Tag);
```

### Key methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `ScheduleAt(dueAtMs, kind, action, tag)` | Absolute time |
| `ScheduleAfter(nowMs, delayMs, kind, action, tag)` | Relative time |
| `DrainReady(nowMs)` | Returns all events with `DueAtMs <= nowMs`, sorted by time then insertion order |

`Kernel.Tick()` calls `Events.DrainReady(NowMs)` after advancing the clock, executing
each action in order.

`IKernel.NowMs` delegates to `Clock.UptimeMs()` — monotonic uptime since simulation
epoch, not `DateTime` subtraction.

---

## 5. Hardware State Machines (Phase 3 plan)

Three hardware components are modelled as state machines. Currently they still use
`BlockFor` (a `Thread.Sleep` wrapper in `HardwareProfile`). The state machines describe
the intended target architecture.

### 5.1 Disk

**Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED**

```
Running ──[idle >30s]──► Stopped
Running ──[idle 2-30s]──► Coasting
Stopped ──[access]──► Running (adds 300ms spindle spin-up)
Coasting ──[access]──► Running (adds 80ms coast→full speed)
Running ──[access]──► Running (no extra delay)
```

The spindle state is tracked in `DiskController` with transitions recalculated each kernel tick
via `UpdateSpindleState(nowMs)`. Disk access incurs spin-up latency only on state change.

**Implementation details:**
- `HardwareProfile`: Added `DiskSpinUpMs` (300ms), `DiskCoastMs` (80ms), `DiskIdleStopMs` (30s), `DiskCoastThresholdMs` (2s)
- `DiskController`: Tracks spindle `_lastAccessMs` and `_state` (enum). `Acquire(nowMs)` returns spin-up cost.
- `MinixSyscallGate`: Calls `_res.DiskCtrl.Acquire(_clock.UptimeMs())` in `LatencyFor()`, passing current time.
- `Kernel.Tick()`: Calls `Resources.DiskCtrl.UpdateSpindleState(NowMs)` each tick to advance state.

**Latency model:**
- DiskRead: `Acquire(spin-up) + TransferTime + Contention + CPU overhead`
- All disk ops use the state machine; network ops unaffected

### 5.2 Network / Modem

```
Idle ──[dial]──► ATH0 (0ms)
ATH0 ──► OK (200ms)
OK ──► ATDT dialing (100ms)
ATDT ──► DIALING... (300ms)
DIALING... ──► RINGING (800ms + baud factor)
RINGING ──► CONNECT <baud> (1200-2200ms handshake)
Connected ──[hangup]──► Idle
```

`SimulatedModem.Dial()` now uses `uow.ScheduleOutput()` to emit each phase
with appropriate delays. Each line arrives with realistic spacing instead of
all at once. The dial sequence:
1. ATH0 reset line (immediate, 0ms)
2. OK response (200ms after reset)
3. ATDT phone number command (100ms after OK)
4. DIALING... notification (300ms after command)
5. RINGING feedback (800ms + modem-speed factor)
6. CONNECT handshake (1200ms to 2200ms depending on baud rate)

**Latency sources:**
- Hayes AT modem: 2400 baud typical (1991)
- Handshake time: scales with baud (3500ms @ 300 baud, 800ms @ 2400 baud)
- Phone book: checks known hosts for reachability
- Unknown hosts: synthesized phone number from IP octets for realism

**Implementation:**
- `IModem.Dial()` signature changed to accept `IUnitOfWork` instead of `TextWriter`
- `SimulatedModem.Dial()` schedules each line via `uow.ScheduleOutput(text, delayMs)`
- `FtpApplication.HandleOpen()` updated to pass `uow` instead of `uow.Out`
- Modem state (Connected) still tracked via `_connected` boolean

### 5.3 Network packet queue

```
Connect(host, port)
    │
    └─ Create NetworkPacketQueue(host, rttMs=50, bandwidthBytesPerMs=3)
            │
            ├─ Per-socket tracking: _packetQueues[fd]
            │
            └─ Available methods:
                ├─ EnqueueResponse(data, nowMs)  — schedule packet for delivery
                ├─ DrainReady(nowMs)            — get packets ready to deliver
                └─ Peek, PendingCount           — diagnostic accessors
```

Each socket maintains its own `NetworkPacketQueue` which models:
- **RTT (50ms)**: round-trip time to remote host
- **Bandwidth (3 bytes/ms = 24 Kbps)**: typical 1991 modem speed
- **Cumulative transfer time**: each packet adds transfer delay for the next

When a command sends data over a socket, the response packet is scheduled based on:
1. Initial RTT (50ms to reach remote)
2. Response bytes / bandwidth (transfer time)
3. RTT back (50ms)

The kernel event loop can poll all packet queues each tick and fire `Network`
events when packets are ready, enabling event-driven networking instead of
blocking `BlockFor()` calls.

**Implementation:**
- `NetworkPacketQueue.cs`: Queue with `EnqueueResponse()`, `DrainReady(nowMs)`, and `Peek` for diagnostics
- `SimulatedNetwork._packetQueues`: Dictionary of `fd → NetworkPacketQueue`
- `Connect()`: Creates a queue for the new socket
- `Close()`: Removes the queue when socket is closed
- `GetPacketQueues()`: Exposes queues to kernel event loop for polling

```
[Command.Execute(uow)]
        │
        ├─ uow.ScheduleOutput("line", 200)
        │       │
        │       └─ Protocol.EmitLine(sink, "line", cumulativeMs)
        │               │
        │               └─ IPC: "emit-line:400:line\n"
        │                           │
        │                     [engine_io_system]
        │                     accumulated_ms += dt_ms
        │                     if due_at <= accumulated_ms:
        │                         push to terminal output
        │
        └─ kernel.Schedule(KernelEventKind.Disk, 40, callback)
                │
                └─ KernelEventQueue.ScheduleAfter(nowMs, 40, ...)
                        │
                  [Kernel.Tick()]
                  DrainReady(NowMs) → fires callback
                  callback → uow.ScheduleOutput(result, 0)
```
